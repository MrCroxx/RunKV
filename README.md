# RunKV

**Still working in progress.**

**TOY ONLY!**

RunKV is an experimental key-value storage engine for OLTP workload based on S3 and cloud disk. The goal is to reduce storage costs while the performace fallback is tolerable.

*This is my master graduation project. Better gonna run, or I must run.*
